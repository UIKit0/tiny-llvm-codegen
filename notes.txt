Codegen supports the following integer types:

i32: The most basic type.  This gets a stack slot of 4 bytes.

i16, i8, i1:

   For simplicity of implementation, these are allocated stack slots
   of 4 bytes as well.

   These stack slots are not necessarily zero-extended, so the upper
   bits can contain garbage.  We don't use x86's 16-bit or 8-bit
   arithmetic instructions (addw, addb, etc.), so multiplying 0x80*2
   as i8 will overflow and be stored as 0x100.  Operations for which
   this matters (e.g. division) must zero-extend their inputs first.

i64: This gets a stack slot of 8 bytes.
